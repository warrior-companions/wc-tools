## Zim Files Readme

This directory must exist if you will use the Kiwix-serve container.

***IMPORTANT***: The `kiwix-serve` container will not run without any `.zim` files stored in the `./zim-files/` directory. At least one `.zim` file must exist in the `./zim-files/` directory.

Content can be downloaded from the [Kiwix library](https://library.kiwix.org/) (URL: https://library.kiwix.org/), as a `.zim` file then loaded into the Kiwix server.
